# JavaScript Fundamental Quiz 

## Description 
This web application is a JavaScript fundamentals quiz that can be used to do a simple comparison between myself and peers on fundamental knowledge about JavaScript. This web application is a timed, multiple-choice quiz where each incorrect answer will deduct a certain amount of time during the quiz. The quiz begins when the user clicks on the start button and is completed when the user answers all questions. The number of questions answered correctly by the user and seconds left will determine the overall score. When the quiz is finished, the user can submit their initials and see their scores as well as previous ones stored from the local storage. 


## Technologies Used

This JavaScript fundamentals quiz web application uses HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript. The local storage is also used to store and save user information including initials, quiz question scores, and time left from quiz.


## Future Updates
The high scores page will be updated where user information will be automatically sorted from highest to lowest scores stored in the local storage.
